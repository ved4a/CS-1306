# Vigenere Cipher Decryption

This is my solution set to Q8 from PSET 1.

## Approach

I closely followed _Cracking Codes with Python: An Introduction to Building and Breaking Ciphers_ by Al Sweigart for my approach. Chapter 20 of the textbook covers the Vigenere Cipher, and I followed the video by _Learning Python_ on YouTube. After watching the video, I implemented the code myself.

## Running the Program

Download the files, and enter ciphertext in the file _answer-8.py_. Then click run, and the terminal will open as the computer attempts to crack it.

## Did it Compile?

No, and I'm unsure where I have gone wrong.
